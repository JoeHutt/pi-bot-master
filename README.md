Pi Bot is a fork of [Bird Bot](https://github.com/natewong1313/bird-bot), a bot aimed at helping people obtain consoles during the pandemic.

Instead of switches, Pi Bot aims at helping people obtain Raspberry Pis + other hard to obtain Maker/AI items, such are Coral USB Accelerators and NVIDIA Jetson Dev Kits

* Easy to use interface built on PyQt5
* Waits for items to restock if they are out of stock
* Lighting fast auto-checkout
* Lightweight to handle multiple tasks
* Captcha Harvester (credit to [NoahCardoza's Captcha Harvester](https://github.com/NoahCardoza/CaptchaHarvester))
