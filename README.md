Pi Bot is a fork of [Bird Bot](), a bot aimed at helping people obtain consoles during the pandemic.

Instead of switches, Pi Bot aims at helping people obtain Raspberry Pis + other hard to obtain Maker/AI items, such are Coral USB Accelerators and NVIDIA Jetson Dev Kits

* Easy to use interface built on PyQt5
* Waits for items to restock if they are out of stock
* Lighting fast auto-checkout
